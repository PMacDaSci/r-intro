## R notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks (*`*). Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Play* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac). 

__Your turn__: Run the code in this block.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert* button on the toolbar, then selecting *R* or by pressing  *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Windows) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).

You can __Knit__ a document ((click the *Knit*/*Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+K* (Mac)) to produce a final report that you can share with others. This will re-run all the code and create a self-contained html file can you share with others.

__Your turn__: Knit this document and find the html file that it generates.

__Your turn__: You're all done, so please put up a green post-it!
