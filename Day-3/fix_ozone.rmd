#Clean Ozone
This chunk will read in the existing ozone dataset.
    In order to work better with ggplot2 we need to fix a few things:
        * `Months` is coded with integers, we will recode this into an ordered factor variable
        * Both `Ozone` and `Solar.R` contain missing values, we will impute the monthly mean to replace NA values.
    Once that's done, we'll save a copy of the clean dataset for future use.
```{r clean ozone}
ozone <- read_csv('../ozone.csv')

ozone <- ozone %>% 
    group_by(Month) %>% 
    mutate(Ozone = round(impute_mean(Ozone),0),
           Solar.R = round(impute_mean(Solar.R),0)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    write_csv(path = 'ozone_clean.csv')
```
